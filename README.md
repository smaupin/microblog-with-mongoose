Scot's Microblog:

A one-page micro-blog that accepts a text-input and uses jQuery to 
	1. Create an object for that post, which can be used later for sorting, or search purposes.
	2. Appends the text to the top of the list of posts below with a date/timestamp.

for future development:
	-make a delete button for posts.
	-add a button to sort by date (ascending and descending) or post content alphaebtically (ascending and descending)
	-make comments
	-allow likes for posts
	-allow share for posts
	-pagination when posts reach a certain number.
	-when scrolling place input bar at the top and stay there.
	-animation to make UX of posting better
	-disallow blank and space only input.
